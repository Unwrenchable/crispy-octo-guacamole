## 🚢 Deployment

### Backend (Render.com - Free)

1. **Create Render account** at [render.com](https://render.com)

2. **Create New Web Service**
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select `backend` directory
   - Use these settings:
     - Build Command: `npm install`
     - Start Command: `npm start`
     - Add environment variable: `CLIENT_URL` = your frontend URL

3. **Get your backend URL** (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com`)

### Frontend (Vercel - Free)

1. **Create Vercel account** at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

2. **Import your repository**
   - Select `frontend` directory
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Add environment variable:
     - `VITE_SOCKET_URL` = your backend URL from Render

3. **Deploy!**
   - Vercel will auto-deploy on every push
   - Get your frontend URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

4. **Update backend CLIENT_URL**
   - Go back to Render
   - Update `CLIENT_URL` environment variable to your Vercel URL
   - Redeploy backend

### Alternative: Deploy Both on Render

You can also deploy both backend and frontend on Render.com's free tier.

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding More Questions

Currently, hosts add questions manually. You can integrate the Open Trivia DB API:

```javascript
// Example: Fetch questions from Open Trivia DB
const response = await fetch('https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&type=multiple');
const data = await response.json();
```

### Changing Scoring

Edit the scoring logic in `backend/server.js`:

```javascript
submitAnswer(teamId, answer) {
  // Current: 100 points + 50 time bonus
  // Customize here!
  let points = 0;
  if (isCorrect) {
    points = 100;
    const timeBonus = Math.max(0, Math.floor(50 * (1 - answerTime / (question.timeLimit * 1000))));
    points += timeBonus;
  }
  // ...
}
```

### Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS. Modify colors and styles in:
- Individual component files (`.jsx` files in `frontend/src/pages/`)
- Tailwind config: `frontend/tailwind.config.js`
- Global styles: `frontend/src/index.css`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Players can't connect to the game

- Check that backend is running and accessible
- Verify CORS settings in `backend/server.js`
- Ensure `VITE_SOCKET_URL` in frontend matches backend URL

### PWA not updating

- Clear browser cache
- Uninstall and reinstall the PWA
- Check service worker in browser DevTools

### Socket connection issues

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify WebSocket support in your hosting environment
- Render.com free tier may sleep after inactivity (takes ~30 seconds to wake up)
